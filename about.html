            <h2>About Tech Refuge</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>Founded in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, Tech Refuge emerged as a response to the growing digital divide in our community. We are a non-profit organization created by a collaboration of students from various high schools in the Greensboro area. We raise, repurpose, and redistribute technologies to those who need them most.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>Our goal is to help as many individuals living in the Greensboro area who lack access to the technologies that we raise. We want to ensure everyone feels included in the modern tech-driven world with new modern devices. Not only do we strive to ensure they acquire these tech items, but we also want to help support them in their tech journey through our free digital classes which teach them the basics of using the devices.</p>

                <p>We are proud to be fiscally sponsored by Hack Club Bank, which helps us manage our finances and donations effectively. This partnership allows us to focus on our mission while ensuring financial transparency and accountability.</p>
